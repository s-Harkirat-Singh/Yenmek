Hi! I’ve built a full itinerary generator web app that currently uses Firebase Auth and Firestore to:

✅ Let users generate itineraries  
✅ Save them under their account (auth-required)  
✅ Display saved itineraries in a dashboard  
✅ Delete and download PDFs of itineraries  
✅ Use a floating menu for login/logout/dashboard  

Now, I want to migrate this project from Firebase to **MongoDB Atlas** as the backend database.

📦 Here’s how the app currently works:

- `modern-sesign.html`: main itinerary generator
  - Users can generate 3 itineraries without login
  - Beyond that, they must log in to add/delete/replace locations or download PDF
  - Uses `showAuthForm()` for login/signup with Firebase Auth

- `dashboard.html`: displays saved itineraries
  - Shows only trips saved by the authenticated user
  - Allows deletion and PDF download
  - Protected by Firebase Auth

🔐 Authentication:
- Currently using Firebase Auth (email/password)
- Auth status controls access to all major features

🗂 Data structure in Firestore:


📦 What I want to do:
- Replace Firebase Auth with my own Express + JWT-based auth
- Replace Firestore with MongoDB Atlas
- Set up my own backend (Node.js + Express) to handle:
  - Sign up / log in
  - Itinerary CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete)
- Still keep frontend in HTML/JS (can fetch from backend with `fetch()`)

Can you help me migrate this to a full **MongoDB Atlas + Express.js backend setup** with the same frontend functionality?

Let’s start with the backend structure, then auth, and API routes for saving/fetching itineraries.
